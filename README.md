# ImageDecimator

ImageDecimator is a rapid image ranking/culling application.

It displays 4 images on the screen simultaneously.

The user picks the best image by clicking 1-4.

The best image and the other 3 images are moved to separate folders.

Then the next set of 4 images is displayed.

The idea is to be able to work through 1,000 images with just 250 keystrokes.
